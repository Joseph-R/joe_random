# Twilight Imperium 4

The cruel Lazax, who ruled for generations, have been overthrown in an galactic civil war spanning hundreds of years.  Many of the strongest civilizations that survived are exhausted.  At the same time newer, upstart factions are rising to power, ancient enemies have resurfaced, and new galactic threats have emerged.  Who will lead the galaxy into the new age?

### First Timers
Welcome new players!  This is a friendly group.  We champion "The Rule of Fun" and are happy to help you out.  The early rounds of TI:4 tend to be more focused on exploring/expanding than conflict, which makes them pretty beginner friendly so you can get comfortable with the mechanics.  We're usually pretty liberal with mulligans in rounds 1-2 as well.

In order to play your best game and be considerate of all players' time, please do the following:
*  Take 30-60m and brush up on the core mechanics and rules before you arrive.  If we are doing a draft and you know your faction before game day, you may also want to review a faction guide to learn about their special abilities.  There are tons of content for either.  We posted some helpful links down below.
*  Be punctual.  
*  Be sure you can commit to a whole day of play.  Play time can vary wildly, between 4-12+ hours, depending on player count and any number of other variables.  We know it's a commitment, and we take steps to keep things moving.  [Help us help you!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1B1_jQnlFk&t=78s)

Beginner Advice:
* **Focus on the objectives!**  - Objectives are the boss.  TI:4 is not a wargame or even an area control/king of the hill game, although it has dynamics of each and can appear that way at a glance.  It's a race to score the most objective points the fastest.  Keep your eye on the prize!
* **Recommended Factions for New Players** - We recommend lower complexity factions to new players.  This does not mean "weak".  Some of these factions are among the strongest in the game!  But their straightforward mechanics and timing windows reduce cognitive load, freeing new players up to learn all the new stuff and play their best game. 
    * Argent Flight, Barony, Empyrean, Hacan, Jol Nar, L1Z1X, Naaz-Rokha, Nomad, Sol, Xxcha 
* Tech - Movement is key for objectives, so keep an eye on blue and unit upgrades that grant movement.  Vanilla TI:4 guides leaned heavily into blue tech, but in PoK AI Dev and Psychoarcheology open up unit upgrade paths that had not previosuly been accessible.
    * Also keep an eye on your faction specific tech/unit upgrades.
* Diplomacy and Trade - Find a buddy!  You'll have an easier game if you find at least one neighbor/trade partner willing to wash your commodities and (hopefully) take steps to establish a peaceful border.  Consider who you might want to exchange Support for the Throne points with early on, especially if there is an odd number of players at the table.
* Combat - Where diplomacy ends, ass kicking begins! 
    * Tactical aggression to complete an objective or block/secure a win can be good.  But as a general rule every fight you did not _need_ to be involved in slows down your objective momentum and drains your resources.  
    * HP wins fights - Play around with one of the [battle calculators](https://ti4battle.com/) if you get bored, but the takeaway is that your ability to take hits and outlast damage is the most consistently reliable way to win combat.  Fancy tech and upgraded units are nice, but if you don't have the slickest faction abilities or you're struggling to ugprade tech, then building big/cheap fleets and stacking up lots of HP is a great way to take and hold territory.
    * Space Combat for Show, Ground Combat for Dough - If you're trying to take territory, winning the space combat and losing the ground combat doesn't do you much good.  You drove all the way across the galaxy and now you're just circling the parking lot.  If you're going to invade, bring enough ground forces to win the planet.  
    * Don't forget retreats!  Not every combat is to the death.  Retreats save your resources, and can be part of deals to swap planets/systems, or that help a faction get XYZ thing they need ("win a combat", "destroy/capture a unit", whatever) or even a sneaky forward move in the case of Dark Energy Tap or similar ability.
* Stay in it until the end!  There are many paths to victory.  The front runners may trip each other up at the end, opening the door for you to sneak in a win from behind.  ["That's SO Twilight Imperium!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLybps39ZwM&t=376s)
    * The Imperial strategy card can be a great catch up strategy if you fall behind on objective tempo in the early game.


### Organizing Game Days
We play roughly once per month.  We send out a "save the date" calendar invite for the next game in advance, then gather RSVPs and feedback and adjust our game day's date/time/location based on group feedback.  When we've got enough players confirmed to lock in a date, we send out an updated invite to the players who have RSVPed with the location, start time, and any other particulars of the upcoming game.  

For async comms, we have a group chat running on Facebook Messenger.  If you are not already in the chat and would like to be, please ask any group member for an invite.  We may organize other games or events through the Messenger chat as things come up. 

In the event we get too many players responding, player seats will be reserved on a "first come, first served" basis.  So please be sure to RSVP promptly when you are sure you can commit to a game day.    


### Keeping it Fresh
TI:4 is an epic game with a lot of variety built in through the 25 player factions, variable map setup, different neighbors, and randomized objectives and agendas.  There's a lot of content here.  To mix it up even more, there are optional game modes, community content, and other modular changes we can pull in.  These include the following:

*  [4/4/4 to 12VP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIVU-4sjaXE) - Community variant where you play with four stage one objectives, four stage two objectives, and four secret objectives.  This accelerates point tempo, effectively speeding up the game.
*  [Alliance Mode](https://twilight-imperium.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_Game_Variant) - Optional playmode for alliances. 
*  [Absol's Agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HMq6XEd5-kbOScwSCypOwytkanwOXfEj) - Community agenda deck.  Notably "spicier" and more impactful than the stock agenda deck, for those who wish the Agenda phase was more impactful on the game.  
*  [Absol's Relics](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-E-Rnsb0VUoluRy5LrURZg2o2V8iw3gZ) - Community relic deck.  Includes tweaks to existing relics and adds some artwork.  Notably adds more Shards of the Throne relics, which grant a stealable victory point.  This can shorten the game and/or induce more conflict.
*  [Minor Factions](https://x.com/CreussEmissary/status/1792421868885959064/photo/2) - Rumored content for a future codex or expansion.  
*  [Age of Exploration](https://x.com/CreussEmissary/status/1792421868885959064/photo/1) - Rumored content for a future codex or expansion.
*  [Feast or Famine (4P)](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2325692/4-player-ti4-feast-and-famine)
*  [We're All Villains Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFSyD5QyhqY) - Everyone plays a "bad" faction or galactic threat.

Any particularly impactful changes to gameplay/strategy should be decided before we pick factions or select the map. 
 We will include any fun/random game mode changes in the game day invites so that people have time to prepare.


### Rules We Forgot or Messed Up
Listen, there's a lot going on in this game.  Things can get wonky, and every game is a "best effort" on behalf of the table.  We learn with experience.  Keeping this list as a scratchpad to remind us of things we goofed in games gone by.  

* [Warfare secondary does not activate home system](https://www.tirules.com/R_warfare) - A strategy token is spent, but it is **not** placed in your home system.  
* [Trade goods can be spent as resources/influence](https://twilight-imperium.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_Goods_%26_Commodities) - This includes following the secondary of Leadership.  But they cannot be used as influence for votes during the Agenda phase, unless another card/power allows that.
* Starting Game Setup - Players place three command tokens in their tactics and fleet pools, and two in strategy.  Draw one secret objective. [No action cards](https://www.tirules.com/R_action_cards#:~:text=Players%20start%20the%20game%20with,dealt%20out%20in%20initiative%20order.), [no commodities](https://www.tirules.com/R_commodities).
* [Production](https://www.tirules.com/R_production) - Each fighter/infantry build during a PRODUCTION tactical action counts against the production limit that turn.
* [Sling Relay](https://twilight-imperium.fandom.com/wiki/Propulsion_Technologies#Sling_Relay), Chaos Mapping, etc - These techs allow you [to produce a unit](https://www.tirules.com/R_producing_units), but **do not** use the tactical action PRODUCTION, so discounts from Sarween and AI Dev (or other abilities) do not apply, nor do any abilities triggered by using PRODUCTION.  The wording could be better here.
* [Imperial allows you to replace unscored Secret Objectives](https://www.tirules.com/R_imperial) - If you have more than three, you may draw a new secret objective and discard an unscored one.
