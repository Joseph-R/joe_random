# Twilight Imperium 4


### First Timers
Welcome!  This is a friendly group.  We champion "The Rule of Fun" and are happy to help new players out.  The early rounds of TI:4 tend to be more about exploring/expanding than conflict anyways, which naturally makes them pretty beginner friendly so you can get comfortable with the mechanics.  We're usually pretty liberal with mulligans and such in rounds 1-2.  

In order to play your best game and be considerate of all player's time, please do the following:
*  Take 30-60m and brush up on the core mechanics and rules before you arrive.  If we're doing a draft, you may also want to review your faction's special abilities.  Ton of content online and on YouTube for this. Please find some helpful guides linked below.
*  Be punctual.  
*  Be sure you can commit to a whole day of play.  Play time can vary wildly, between 4-12+ hours, depending on player count and any number of other variables.  We know it's a commitment, and we take steps to keep things moving. 

General Advice:
* **Focus on the objectives!**  You win by completing objectives.  TI:4 is not a wargame, although it can appear that way at a glance.  Games can be played and won without a single combat taking place.  Tactical aggression can be good, but as a general rule every fight you did not _need_ to be involved in slows down your momentum and drains your resources.  The game has economic, political, and exploration mechanics that all help you win objectives.  Use them, and keep your eye on the prize.
* Diplomacy and Trade - You'll have an easier game if you find at least one trade partner willing to wash your commodities and (hopefully) take steps to establish a peaceful border.  Consider who you might want to exchange Support for the Throne points with early on, especially if there is an odd number of players at the table.     
* Tech - Blue tech focuses on mobility, and mobility is key to expanding out into your slice early, to scoring various objectives, and to getting your resources where they need to be for combat when the time comes.
* HP wins fights - If you _have_ to fight you want to win, right?  Play around with one of the [battle calculators](https://ti4battle.com/) if you get bored, but the takeaway is that your ability to take hits and outlast damage is the most consistently reliable way to win combat.  Tech and fancy/upgraded units are nice, but if you don't have the slickest faction abilities or you're struggling to ugprade tech, then building big/cheap fleets and stacking up lots of HP is a great way to take and hold territory.


### Organizing Game Days
One of us typically sends out a "save the date" calendar invite for the next game a few weeks in advance.  We gather RSVPs and feedback and adjust date/time/location to suit the group's feedback.  Then we send out an updated invite to the players who have RSVPed with the location, start time, and any other particulars.  

For async comms, we have a group chat running on Facebook Messenger.  If you are not already in the chat and would like to be, please ask any group member for an invite.  We may organize other games or events through the Messenger chat as things come up. 

In the event we get too many players responding, player seats will be reserved on a "first come, first served" basis re: RSVPs.  So please be sure to RSVP promptly when you are sure you can commit to a game day.    


### Keeping it Fresh
Optional game modes, community content, etc to keep things fresh.  If we are planning to pull in any specific changes, they will be noted in the calendar invite for game day.

*  [4/4/4 to 12VP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIVU-4sjaXE) - Community variant where you play with four stage one objectives, four stage two objectives, and four secret objectives.  This accelerates point tempo, effectively speeding up the game.
*  [Alliance Mode](https://twilight-imperium.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_Game_Variant) - Optional playmode for alliances. 
*  [Absol's Agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HMq6XEd5-kbOScwSCypOwytkanwOXfEj) - Community agenda deck.  Notably "spicier" and more impactful than the stock agenda deck, for those who wish the Agenda phase was more impactful on the game.  
*  [Absol's Relics](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-E-Rnsb0VUoluRy5LrURZg2o2V8iw3gZ) - Community relic deck.  Includes tweaks to existing relics and adds some artwork.  Notably adds more Shards of the Throne relics, which grant a stealable victory point.  This can shorten the game and/or induce more conflict.
*  [Minor Factions](https://x.com/CreussEmissary/status/1792421868885959064/photo/2) - Rumored content for a future codex or expansion.  
*  [Age of Exploration](https://x.com/CreussEmissary/status/1792421868885959064/photo/1) - Rumored content for a future codex or expansion.
