# Twilight Imperium 4

The galaxy has overthrown the cruel Lazax, who ruled for generations, in a galaxy spanning civil war that left many of the strongest factions exhausted at the same time newer, upstart factions are vying for power.  Who will lead the galaxy now?  Find out, in Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition!    


### First Timers
Welcome!  This is a friendly group.  We champion "The Rule of Fun" and are happy to help new players out.  The early rounds of TI:4 tend to be more about exploring/expanding than conflict anyways, which naturally makes them pretty beginner friendly so you can get comfortable with the mechanics.  We're usually pretty liberal with mulligans and such in rounds 1-2.  

In order to play your best game and be considerate of all player's time, please do the following:
*  Take 30-60m and brush up on the core mechanics and rules before you arrive.  If we're doing a draft and you know your faction before game day, you may also want to review a faction guide to learn about their special abilities.  Ton of online content for this.  Please find some helpful guides linked below.
*  Be punctual.  
*  Be sure you can commit to a whole day of play.  Play time can vary wildly, between 4-12+ hours, depending on player count and any number of other variables.  We know it's a commitment, and we take steps to keep things moving. 

General Advice:
* **Focus on the objectives!**  - TI:4 is not a wargame or even an area control/king of the hill game, although it has dynamics of each and can appear that way at a glance.  You win by completing objectives.  Objectives are the boss.  Games can be played and won without a single combat taking place.  Tactical aggression can be good, but as a general rule every fight you did not _need_ to be involved in slows down your momentum and drains your resources.  The game has economic, political, and exploration mechanics that all help you win objectives.  Use them, and keep your eye on the prize.
* Diplomacy and Trade - You'll have an easier game if you find at least one trade partner willing to wash your commodities and (hopefully) take steps to establish a peaceful border.  Consider who you might want to exchange Support for the Throne points with early on, especially if there is an odd number of players at the table.     
* Tech - Movement is key.  Vanilla TI:4 guides leaned heavily into the Blue tech tree, which focuses on mobility and gatekept many unit upgrades.  Even in PoK, you will rarely go wrong choosing blue tech round one or two.  However the tech trees are more varied in the expansion, with AI Dev and Psychoarcheology opening up unit upgrade paths that had not previously been available.  
* HP wins fights - If you _have_ to fight, you want to win, right?  Play around with one of the [battle calculators](https://ti4battle.com/) if you get bored, but the takeaway is that your ability to take hits and outlast damage is the most consistently reliable way to win combat.  Tech and fancy/upgraded units are nice, but if you don't have the slickest faction abilities or you're struggling to ugprade tech, then building big/cheap fleets and stacking up lots of HP is a great way to take and hold territory.  
* Stay in it until the end!  There are many paths to victory.  The front runners may trip each other up at the end, opening the door for you to sneak in a win from behind.  Imperial can be a great catch up strategy card if you fall behind on tempo in the early game.


### Organizing Game Days
As of June 2024, we play roughly once per month.  We send out a "save the date" calendar invite for the next game a few weeks in advance.  Then we gather RSVPs and feedback and adjust date/time/location based on group feedback.  When we've got enough players confirmed to lock in a date, we send out an updated invite to the players who have RSVPed with the location, start time, and any other particulars of the upcoming game.  

For async comms, we have a group chat running on Facebook Messenger.  If you are not already in the chat and would like to be, please ask any group member for an invite.  We may organize other games or events through the Messenger chat as things come up. 

In the event we get too many players responding, player seats will be reserved on a "first come, first served" basis.  So please be sure to RSVP promptly when you are sure you can commit to a game day.    


### Keeping it Fresh
TI:4 is an epic game with a lot of variety already built in through player factions, map setup, neighboring, and randomized objectives and agendas.  There's a lot of content here.  To mix it up even more, there are optional game modes, community content, and other modular changes we can pull in whenever we want.  These include the following:

*  [4/4/4 to 12VP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIVU-4sjaXE) - Community variant where you play with four stage one objectives, four stage two objectives, and four secret objectives.  This accelerates point tempo, effectively speeding up the game.
*  [Alliance Mode](https://twilight-imperium.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_Game_Variant) - Optional playmode for alliances. 
*  [Absol's Agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HMq6XEd5-kbOScwSCypOwytkanwOXfEj) - Community agenda deck.  Notably "spicier" and more impactful than the stock agenda deck, for those who wish the Agenda phase was more impactful on the game.  
*  [Absol's Relics](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-E-Rnsb0VUoluRy5LrURZg2o2V8iw3gZ) - Community relic deck.  Includes tweaks to existing relics and adds some artwork.  Notably adds more Shards of the Throne relics, which grant a stealable victory point.  This can shorten the game and/or induce more conflict.
*  [Minor Factions](https://x.com/CreussEmissary/status/1792421868885959064/photo/2) - Rumored content for a future codex or expansion.  
*  [Age of Exploration](https://x.com/CreussEmissary/status/1792421868885959064/photo/1) - Rumored content for a future codex or expansion.


Any particularly impactful changes to gameplay/strategy should be decided before we pick factions or select the map.  We will include any fun/random game mode changes in the game day invites so that people have time to prepare.
